        <h1 class="title">Biography</h1>
        <p>
            Paul Dedrick Gray was born in Los Angeles, California. Later his family relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. He
            played guitar but switched to bass after he relocated to Iowa. In his youth, Gray performed in bands such as
            Anal Blast, Vexx, Body Pit, The Have Nots and Inveigh Catharsis.

            In June 2003, Gray crashed his car into another vehicle. After police were called to the scene and searched
            his car, Gray was arrested for possession of marijuana, cocaine and drug paraphernalia, as well as failure
            to obey a traffic signal.[3][4]

            At the time of his death, he was one of three original members of Slipknot remaining in the band, and the
            only one who had maintained his original role in the band due to Clown's switch from main drums to custom
            percussion during the early days. He was one of the two members not born in Iowa (the other is Jim Root, who
            was born in Las Vegas). In 2010, Slipknot released the Download 2009 performance on DVD in memory of Gray.

            Besides Slipknot, Gray filled in as bassist for Unida during their 2003 tour, appeared on Drop Dead,
            Gorgeous and Worse Than a Fairy Tale, toured briefly with Reggie and the Full Effect and appeared on the
            Roadrunner United project, performing bass on "The Enemy" and "Baptized in the Redemption" from the
            project's album The All-Star Sessions.

            An award was named after Paul titled "Paul Gray: Best Bassist of the Year", as a tribute to Paul. Slipknot
            presented the award to Nikki Sixx, of Mötley Crüe and Sixx A.M..

        <h1 class="title">Death</h1>
        <p>
            On May 24, 2010, The Des Moines Register reported that Gray had been found dead in room 431 at the
            TownePlace Suites Hotel in Johnston, Iowa at about 10:50 a.m. local time.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] In a
            911-call, obtained by TMZ, one of the hotel's proprietors said that a hypodermic needle was found next to
            Gray's bed, as well as many pills that were apparently scattered across the room.[13] An initial autopsy
            determined that no foul play or trauma was involved, but could not establish the cause of death.[8][9][14]
            He is survived by his wife Brenna and their daughter October, who was born after his death.

            On June 21, 2010, autopsy results were released that stated Gray had died of an overdose of morphine, and
            had also shown signs of "significant heart disease".[15]

            <h4> Aftermath</h4>
            <p>
                On the day after Gray's death, May 25, 2010, the band, without their usual masks, held a formal press
                conference in Des Moines, Iowa. They did not take any questions from the media. The band, as well as
                Gray's brother, Tony, and wife, Brenna, paid tribute to him.

                "He was kind of the person in the band that really wanted everybody in the band to always get along and
                just concentrate on the band. He was a really great friend and just a great person. He's going to be
                sadly missed, and the world is going to be a different place without him."

                — Shawn Crahan[16]
                A private funeral was held on May 28, 2010. Paul Gray was buried at the Highland Memory Gardens Cemetery
                in Des Moines, Iowa. On November 8, 2010, items that decorated Gray's grave, including a Buddha statue
                and gargoyle statue, were stolen.[17] The band responded to this event with a post on their MySpace and
                Facebook page, asking the robbers to return the stolen items and appealing for information from the
                public.[18]

                On July 30, Paul Gray was posthumously awarded the Kerrang! "Services to Metal" award; it was collected
                by his Slipknot bandmate Corey Taylor on his behalf.[19]

                Slipknot's former guitarist Donnie Steele filled in on bass guitar for Gray on Slipknot's 2011 Summer
                tour. Slipknot shows during this time featured Paul's jumpsuit and Self-Titled era pig mask on a stand,
                along with a bass guitar standing next to it. Fans honoured Gray with a two-minute silence during the
                band's headline set at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth.[20]

                Corey Taylor also got a tattoo of Gray and his number on the back of his right leg.
